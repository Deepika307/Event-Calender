# Custom Event Calendar

Custom Event Calendar is a responsive React-based application that allows users to manage events in a calendar interface. Users can add, edit, delete, and reschedule events with support for recurring events, color categorization, conflict detection, and drag-and-drop functionality. Data is persisted in the browser using localStorage.
